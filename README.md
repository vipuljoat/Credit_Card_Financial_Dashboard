Credit Card Financial Dashboard Project Description
This project focused on leveraging transactional data to build a powerful financial reporting system, demonstrating expertise in SQL data processing, advanced Power BI visualization, and complex DAX modeling.

1. Project Goal and Scope
The core objective was to analyze customer spending behavior and financial metrics across different card categories to identify revenue drivers and understand customer demographics. The analysis processed over 10,000 transaction records to inform strategic decision-making in product performance and profitability.

2. Data Transformation and Integrity
SQL Processing: Used SQL queries for efficient data extraction, transformation, and load (ETL). This included aggregating transaction data, joining customer demographic profiles, and ensuring the data was properly structured for time-series and segmentation analysis.

Data Modeling: Established a dimensional data model within Power BI to accurately link transactions with customer attributes, allowing for flexible filtering and slicing of financial results.

3. Core Analysis and Strategic Impact
Revenue Performance Analysis: Applied advanced DAX calculations to analyze over $55 Million in total revenue. This analysis segmented performance by card type and customer demographics.

Key Finding: The analysis definitively identified the Blue card category as the top performer, accounting for 47% of total revenue and 35% of all transactions.

Actionable Impact: This finding provided the necessary insight to strategically focus marketing and upgrade campaigns on the Blue card demographic, aiming to increase adoption and revenue share within that proven high-performing segment.

Trend Analysis: The dashboard was equipped with trend views that analyzed quarterly growth and identified potential shifts in spending habits across the customer base.

4. Tools and Deliverables
Tools: SQL, Power BI, DAX.

Deliverable: A highly interactive Power BI dashboard featuring 12+ visualizations including KPI cards, detailed trend lines, and dynamic filters, enabling stakeholders to instantly assess card category performance and customer segmentation views.
